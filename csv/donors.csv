Dart Container Corporation, Big Corporation, $1,600, $0, Corporation, Dart is a single-use container behemoth. The empire is built on the kind of disposable items--coffee cup lids\, plastic knives and forks--that Americans have come to rely on. But the harm of single use plastics and styrofoam is well documented. It takes forever to break down. Fish mistake it for food and eat it\, sending contamination up the food chain. It’s also notoriously hard to recycle and many municipal programs have stopped even accepting it. Sixty countries have banned these types of single use containers. Maine and Maryland banned them in 2019\, the same year Andrew Cuomo proposed a state-wide ban in New York. \nBut Dart is not giving up without a fight. When the city of San Diego instituted a ban on polystyrene foam and single use plastics\, they were sued by Dart\, the California Restaurant Association and three local restaurant owners; forcing the city to suspend the ban pending an environmental impact report. Clearly Dart doesn’t want Los Angeles going any further with plastic and foam bans because they’ve spent thousands of dollars donating to Ryu and almost every other member of the city council for years. \nIn addition to Dart’s products not being great for the environment\, the company’s scions aren’t great either. Kenneth and Robert Dart are the billionaire heirs to their father’s company. Although they have moved on to other interests like running vulture funds that destabilize governments. Both were so averse to paying their taxes that they renounced their citizenship and left the country; one to London\, the other to The Cayman Islands.,link,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/02/business/02dart-07/merlin_163296711_d1f75656-b3ba-4d34-9633-74d72e4cb2ca-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg,Mason\, Michigan
